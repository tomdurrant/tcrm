My notes on running tcrm
========================

- Use venv3.7
- Tom's insertions for write and blend added to py3 recent version
- Blend only works for rMax. rGale probably needs to be provided or calculation is not implemented.
- few legacy(?) tests added by Tom not working (unexistent plotting script)
- Holland 2010 wind field model not implemented
